      "What is JavaScript? It's a programming language that allows you to create dynamic, interactive web pages. You can use it to add interactivity and functionality to your websites.\n",
      "JavaScript was created by Netscape in 1995 as an alternative to Java for adding scripting capabilities to web pages. It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages on the internet.\n",
      "Here are some key things to know about JavaScript:\n",
      "- It runs in a browser\n",
      "- It can be used to manipulate HTML elements\n",
      "- It supports event handling\n",
      "- It has a rich set of built-in functions and libraries\n",
      "- It has powerful debugging tools available\n",
      "- It is object-oriented\n",
      "- It has strong support from the browser vendors\n",
      "If you're interested in learning more about JavaScript, there are many resources available online. Some popular ones include MDN Web Docs, Codecademy, and W3Schools. With practice, you'll be able to write efficient, effective code in no time!\n"
