      "The resume appears relevant to the position, but it lacks details about specific skills required for the role, particularly those related to Python, AWS, and other advanced technologies mentioned in the job description. The candidate's educational background suggests they have some technical knowledge in areas like React, Node.js, and TypeScript, which aligns with the job requirements. However, there is no mention of their proficiency in Python, AWS, or any other advanced technologies, which are crucial for the role. The projects listed do not provide detailed information about the use of these technologies, making it challenging to assess their expertise. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while the resume demonstrates foundational skills in programming languages, front-end and back-end technologies, and project experience, it does not fully match the job requirements in terms of specialized skill sets. Therefore, my evaluation score would be **6** out of 10. Justification: Although the resume indicates potential strengths in core technologies, it falls short in demonstrating proficiency in key technologies like Python, AWS, and others required for the role, especially given the emphasis on these topics in the job description. The lack of concrete evidence of hands-on experience or projects utilizing these advanced technologies further reduces its alignment with the job requirements. A more comprehensive portfolio showcasing these skills might strengthen the candidate's candidacy\n"
